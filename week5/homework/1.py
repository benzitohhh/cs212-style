# -----------------
# User Instructions
# 
# In this problem, you will use a faster version of Pwin, which we will call
# Pwin2, that takes a state as input but ignores whether it is player 1 or 
# player 2 who starts. This will reduce the number of computations to about 
# half. You will define a function, Pwin3, which will be called by Pwin2.
#
# Pwin3 will only take me, you, and pending as input and will return the 
# probability of winning.
#
# Avoid infinite loops!
#
# Take care when value of pending is 0 (special case)
#
# Keep in mind that the probability that I win from a position is always
# (1 - probability that my opponent wins).
